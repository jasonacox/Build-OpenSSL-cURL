## Build Instructions

Build the libraries with macOS support:

```bash
# Standard Build
./build.sh

# Option: Build only macOS
./build.sh -p macos
```

Load and build the project using Xcode. Example lib binaries (xcframework) and header files are included but will be replaced when you run the build script. 

## New Project Setup Details

If you are setting up a new Xcode project, there are few things you will need to set up. These are all set up for you already in the xcodeproj file:

* You will also need to add the xcframework files (libs) and header files (include). You will also need to add libz.tbd, liblapd.tgb, CoreFoundation.framework, and SystemConfiguraiton.framework to the Xcode project ("General").

* You will need to allow "Outgoing Connection (Client)" in the "Signing & Capabilities" of the project target "Sandbox" settings.
