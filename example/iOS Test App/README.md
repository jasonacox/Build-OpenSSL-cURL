This is a test app for iOS using the curl, openssl and nghttp2 libraries.

## Build Instructions

Build the libraries with Mac Catalyst support:

## New Project Setup Details

If you are setting up a new Xcode project, there are few things you will need to set up. These are all set up for you already in the xcodeproj file:

* You will also need to add the xcframework files (libs) and header files (include). You will also need to add libz.tbd to the Xcode project ("General").
