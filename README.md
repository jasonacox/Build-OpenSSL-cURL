This Script builds OpenSSL, nghttp2 and cURL/libcurl for MacOS (x86_64, arm64), Mac Catalyst (x86_64, arm64), iOS (armv7, armv7s, arm64 and arm64e), iOS Simulator (x86_64, arm64), tvOS (arm64) and tvOS Simulator (x86_64).  It includes patching for tvOS to not use fork() and adds HTTP2 support via nghttp2.

## News

* 19-Jan-2025: Version 1.0.0 - Updated build script to allow building for single platform targets: macOS, iOS or tvOS. Specify with `-p macOS`. Default build is for "all" as it has been. Added examples apps for tvOS and macOS.
* 17-Mar-2024: Updated tvOS build script to work with XCode 15.3 and added `--without-libpsl` for cURL due to on-by-default policy (see [cURL blog](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/10/psl-in-curl/)). TODO: Get a static build of libpsl for cross-compile.
* 19-Jul-2023: Added OpenSSL 3.0.x (LTS) Support and removed EOL bitcode for builds going forward.
* 13-Feb-2021: Update now builds XCFrameworks which supports all platforms and targets for easy import into your projects.
* 16-Jan-2021: Updated build scripts to allow user defined minimum macOS, iOS, tvOS and catalyst target build versions. 
* 02-Jan-2021: Apple Silicon [Beta]: The script now builds OpenSSL, nghttp2 and libcurl libraries for MacOS arm64 targets, including iOS Simulator and Mac Catalyst. Script runs on Apple Silicon arm64 and Intel x86_64 build hosts. Not complete: tvOS Simulator.
* 14-Sep-2020: Mac Catalyst: This now optionally builds libraries for [Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/)

## Build

The `build.sh` script calls the three build scripts below (openssl, nghttp and curl) which download the specified release version, configure and build the libraries and binaries.  

The build script accepts several arguments to adjust versions and toggle features:

```
  ./build.sh [-o <OpenSSL version>] [-c <curl version>] [-n <nghttp2 version>] [-d] [-e] [-3] [-x] [-h] [...]

         -o <version>   Build OpenSSL version (default 3.0.15)
         -c <version>   Build curl version (default 8.11.1)
         -n <version>   Build nghttp2 version (default 1.64.0)
         -d             Compile without HTTP2 support
         -e             Compile with OpenSSL engine support
         -b             Compile without bitcode (depreciated)
         -m             Compile Mac Catalyst library
         -u <version>   Mac Catalyst iOS min target version (default 15.0)
         -3             Compile with SSLv3
         -s <version>   iOS min target version (default 8.0)
         -t <version>   tvOS min target version (default 9.0)
         -i <version>   macOS 86_64 min target version (default 14.6.1)
         -a <version>   macOS arm64 min target version (default 14.6.1)
         -x             No color output
         -p <platform>  Build only for specified platform (iOS, tvOS, macOS, or all [default])
         -y             Skip build confirmation
         -h             Show usage
```

_OpenSSL Engine Note: By default, the OpenSSL source disables ENGINE support for iOS builds.  To force this active use this and the static engine support will be included:_ `./build.sh -e`

_Mac Catalyst Note: Static libraries can be built for Mac Catalyst. This often requires that you specify an recent Mac Catalyst iOS target version (e.g. 15.0). To build Catalyst binaries use the -m switch and specify the iOS target with -u:_ `./build.sh -m -u 15.0`

Minimum macOS, iOS and tvOS target build versions are set by default in the build scripts or can be specified using command line arguments indicated above.  Apple Silicon arm64 macOS targets will need to be 11.0 or higher.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this Repo
2. Run the build script
3. Libraries and Binaries will be in the ./archive folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasonacox/Build-OpenSSL-cURL.git
cd Build-OpenSSL-cURL

# Build for all: macOS, iOS, and tvOS
./build.sh

# Build for macOS only
./build.sh -p macos

# build for iOS only
./build.sh -p ios
```

Default versions are specified in the `build.sh` script but you can specify the version you want to build via the command line, e.g.:

```bash
./build.sh -o 1.1.1g -c 7.72.0 -n 1.41.0

# Use -m to build for Mac Catalyst as well
./build.sh -o 1.1.1g -c 7.72.0 -n 1.41.0 -m
```

You can update the default version by editing this section in the `build.sh` script:

```bash
################################################
# EDIT this section to Select Default Versions #
################################################

OPENSSL="3.0.15"	# https://www.openssl.org/source/ - LTS Version
LIBCURL="8.11.1"	# https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
NGHTTP2="1.64.0"	# https://nghttp2.org/

################################################
```

## Details

### Dependencies
The build script requires:
* Xcode 10 or higher (12+ recommended)
* Xcode Command Line Tools
* pkg-config tool for nghttp2 (or `brew` to auto-install)

### OpenSSL
The `openssl-build.sh` script creates separate bitcode enabled target libraries for:
* MacOS - OS X (x86-64, arm64)
* iOS - iPhone (armv7, armv7s, arm64 and arm64e) and iPhoneSimulator (i386, x86-64, arm64)
* tvOS - AppleTVOS (arm64) and AppleTVSimulator (x86-64)

By default, the OpenSSL source disables ENGINE support for iOS builds.  To force this active use `build.sh -e`

The tvOS build has fork() disable as the AppleTV tvOS does not support fork(). 

	|____lib
	   |____libcrypto.a
	   |____libssl.a

NOTE: This script allows building the OpenSSL 3.0.x and 1.1.1 series libraries.  The OpenSSL 1.1.1 series is supported until 11th September 2023. All older versions (including 1.1.0, 1.0.2, 1.0.0 and 0.9.8) are now out of support and should not be used. Users of these older versions are encouraged to upgrade to 3.0 as soon as possible.

### HTTP2 / nghttp2
The `nghttp2-build.sh` script builds the nghttp2 libraries used by libcurl for the HTTP2 protocol.
* MacOS - OS X (x86-64, arm64)
* iOS - iPhone (armv7, armv7s, arm64 and arm64e) and iPhoneSimulator (i386, x86-64, arm64)
* tvOS - AppleTVOS (arm64) and AppleTVSimulator (x86-64)

Edit `build.sh` to change the default version of nghttp2 that will be downloaded and built or specify the version on the command line.

	build.sh -n 1.40.0 

Include the relevant library into your project. The pkg-config tool is required.  The build script tests for this and will attempt to install if it is missing. Rename the appropriate file to libnghttp2.a:

	|____lib
	   |____libnghttp2_iOS.a
	   |____libnghttp2_iOS-simulator.a
	   |____libnghttp2_iOS-fat.a    <-- Contains both iOS and iOS-simulator binaries
	   |____libnghttp2_Mac.a
	   |____libnghttp2_tvOS.a
	   |____libnghttp2_Catalyst.a

DISABLE HTTP2: The nghttp2 build can be disabled by using:

	build.sh -d

### cURL / libcurl
The `libcurl-build.sh` script create separate bitcode enabled targets libraries for:
* MacOS - OS X (x86-64, arm64)
* iOS - iPhone (armv7, armv7s, arm64 and arm64e) and iPhoneSimulator (i386, x86-64, arm64)
* tvOS - AppleTVOS (arm64) and AppleTVSimulator (x86-64)

The curl build uses `--with-ssl` pointing to the above OpenSSL builds and `--with-nghttp2` pointing to the above nghttp2 builds..
Edit `build.sh` to change the version of cURL that will be downloaded and built or specify the version on the command line.

	build.sh -c 7.68.0 
	
Include the relevant library into your project.  Rename the appropriate file to libcurl.a:

	|____lib
	   |____libcurl_iOS.a            <-- Contains iOS (armv7, armv7s, arm64 and arm64e) libraries
	   |____libcurl_iOS-simulator.a  <-- Contains iOS-simulator (x86_64, arm64) libraries
	   |____libcurl_iOS-fat.a        <-- Contains iOS and iOS-simulator (x86_64) libraries
	   |____libcurl_Mac.a            <-- Contains MacOS (x86_64, arm64) libraries
	   |____libcurl_tvOS.a           <-- Contains tvOS (arm64) and tvOS-simulator (x86_64) libraries
	   |____libcurl_Catalyst.a       <-- Contains Mac Catalyst (x86_64, arm64) libraries

NOTE: By default, this script only builds bitcode versions. To build non-bitcode versions:

	build.sh -b

### Xcode

Xcode7.1b or later is required for the tvOS SDK.

To include the OpenSSL and libcurl libraries in your Xcode projects, import the appropriate libraries for your project from:
* Curl - curl/lib [rename to libcurl.a]
* OpenSSL - openssl/Mac/lib, openssl/iOS/lib, openssl/tvOS/lib
* nghttp2 (HTTP2) - nghttp2/lib [rename to libnghttp2.a]

See the example 'iOS Test App'.

### Usage

 1. Clone this Repo 
 2. Run `build.sh` 
 3. Headers, libraries and XCFrameworks are stored in the archives folder. 
 4. Copy the headers to your project.
 5. Import appropriate "libssl.a", "libcrypto.a", "libcurl.a", "libnghttp2.a", or alternatively, you can copy the appropriate xcframework folder into your Xcode project. 
 6. Reference Headers, "Headers/openssl", "Headers/curl".
 7. Specifying the flag  "-lz" in "Other Linker Flags" (OTHER_LDFLAGS) setting in the "Linking" section in the Build settings of the target.
 8. To use cURL, see below:

        #include <curl/curl.h>

        - (void)foo {    
            CURL* cURL = curl_easy_init();  
            ...  
        }

NOTE: You may need to edit the `curlbuild.h` header if you get an error similar to this: `'curl_rule_01' declared as an array with a negative size`

curlbuild.h

	/* The size of `long', as computed by sizeof. */
	// ADD Condition for 64 Bit
	#ifdef __LP64__
	#define CURL_SIZEOF_LONG 8
	#else
	#define CURL_SIZEOF_LONG 4
	#endif

You may also need to edit this section:

	/* Signed integral data type used for curl_off_t. */
	//#define CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_OFF_T long
	//ADD Condition for 64 Bit
	#define CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_OFF_T int64_t

`curl/curlbuild-ios-universal.h` is a universal example, tested on iOS platforms, made out of libcurl-7.50.3. Check the diff between this file and `curlbuild.h` before using it.

### Example Apps

Example Xcode project "iOS Test App" is located in the example folder.  This project builds an iPhone Objective C App using libcurl, openssl, and nghttp2 libraries via XCFrameworks. The app provides a simple single text field interface for URL input and produces a curl response.

The Example app project builds an iOS, iOS Simulator and Mac Catalyst target.

### Issues and Feedback

* Thanks to all of you who submit feedback and create issue tickets to help us improve the build scripts!

## Build Troubleshooting Tips

The AppleTVOS curl build may fail due to a macports "ar" program being picked up (it was in the path - You will see a log message about /opt/local/bin/ar failing in the curl log). A quick cleanup of the path (so that the build uses /usr/bin/ar) fixed the problem.  - Thanks to Preston Jennings (prestonj) for this tip.

If the `build.sh` script fails during iOS build phase with an error "C Compiler cannot create executables" this is likely due to not having a clean installation of the Xcode command line tools.  Launch Xcode and re-install the command line tools. 

If you see "FATAL ERROR" during the nghttp2 build phase, this is likely due to not having 'pkg-config' tools installed.  Install manually or install 'brew' to have the script install it for you.

If you are on a new macOS installation and wonder why the build is failing, you might need to set the correct path for the command line tools:

    xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app

If the build fails for a newer version of one of the libraries, submit a ticket. Please note, the project focuses on supporting long term support (LTS) versions of libraries. OpenSSL in particular, has many dev or short term support versions. These change too freuqently to adequately support. Switch to a LTS version. Submit any errors you get with LTS versions.
